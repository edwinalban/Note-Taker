# Note-Taker
Displays previously saved notes, saves new notes, allows user to delete notes when no longer needed.

## Description

I built this project in order to practice using Express.js. It solves the problem of having to utlize local storage to create/display persistent data, as the data is stored in a json file instead. I learned about middleware usage, generic helper functions, how to create routes for getting/posting/deleting data, wildcard routes, and how to connect front-end javascript to back-end files. I also learned how to test my project with Insomnia.
